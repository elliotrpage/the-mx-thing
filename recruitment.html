<h1>Recruitment</h1>
<h2>(amusing subtitle under review)</h2>
  <p>One thing I should mention is that many countries (the UK included) have a legal requirement for larger companies to report their gender pay gap, which means you will be asked for a binary gender in order to do this. I am not a lawyer, but this may have to be your legal gender, rather than a self-defined one.</p>
