<h3>Monzo</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Current Account</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> No title or gender information requested.</li>
  </ul>
  
<h3>Natwest</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Current account</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> New customer</li>
    <li><strong>Method:</strong> Online </li>
    <li><strong>Result:</strong> Mx title not available. When selecting a neutral option, a mandatory binary gender selector appears. </li>
    <li><strong>Note from Peter:</strong> See below that you can get title in-branch manually, but presumably, not gender. Setting a new account up in-branch may let you select "Mx" from the start.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Current account</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> Existing customer</li>
    <li><strong>Method:</strong> Face-to-face (Knutsford branch) </li>
    <li><strong>Result:</strong> Mx title applied to account and debit card. </li>
    <li><strong>Note from Peter:</strong> When this was done, their main system for doing changes would not let the staff member change the title to Mx. However, the staff member went into some console/DOS looking screens and manually typed in Mx in numerous screens (it took a while, but they were very keen to do it everywhere). Unfortunately, there was one place they missed (paper statements) but I told the Crewe branch and they fixed this straight away.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Credit card</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> Existing customer</li>
    <li><strong>Method:</strong> Phone call </li>
    <li><strong>Result:</strong> Mx title applied to credit card. </li>
    <li><strong>Note from Peter:</strong> Communications (postal/email) use just "M" as a title, despite card saying "MX".</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Post Office Money</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> "Matched" Credit Card</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> Requires a mandatory and gendered title, but what is printed on the card is entirely custom, so you can change the title on the card or remove it entirely (mine says "MX").</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Current account</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> New customer</li>
    <li><strong>Method:</strong> Phone call </li>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> 17/11/2018 </li>
    <li><strong>Result:</strong> Title field is free text box on their system. However, requires a binary gender be selected. I have requested that they add a non-binary checkbox.</li>
  </ul>
  
<h3>Santander</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Current Account</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> Requires a mandatory title during signup. "Mx" is one of the main options, but selecting "Other" gives you a long list of others. Unfortunately, a binary gender is mandatory.</li>
    <li><strong>Contact date:</strong> 16/11/2018 - awaiting response</li>
  </ul>
  
<h3>Scottish Widows</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Pension</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> When initially set up, they copied over what my workplace set as my title (assumed Mr). When I phoned them up to request the title change, they originally asked for deed poll until I eventually talked them down to just requiring a letter "with a signature". I then forgot about needing to send a letter until I moved house and they sent something to the old address and used "Mr" as title. So, when I phoned about changing address, I also asked about changing my title to "Mx", which they did immediately on the phone. I did not mention the request for a letter on this second attempt.</li>
    <li><strong>SHAME UPDATE - 29th October 2018:</strong> The latest letter from Scottish Widows has returned to using "Mr". I will be contacting about this.</li>
  </ul>
  
<h3>Starling Bank</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Personal Current Account</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> Requires a mandatory title during signup. "Mx" is available on <strong>Android only</strong>, on iOS the only neutral option is "Dr".</li>
    <li><strong>Contact date:</strong> 16/11/2018 - awaiting response</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Yorkshire Building Society</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contributed By:</strong> h0m54r</li>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Mortgage</li>
    <li><strong>Report:</strong> When I applied for a mortgage with YBS, the paperwork I saw listed Mx as a selectable option along with the more traditional titles. Donâ€™t know if that applies to their other products.</li>
  </ul>
