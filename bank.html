<h1>Finance</h1>
<h2>Not just a bunch of bankers</h2>
  
<h3>Barclays</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Current account</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> New customer</li>
    <li><strong>Method:</strong> Online </li>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> 17th November 2018 </li>
    <li><strong>Result:</strong> Mx title available. However, requires a binary gender be selected. </li>
  </ul>
  
<h3>The Co-operative Bank</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Current account</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> New customer</li>
    <li><strong>Method:</strong> Online </li>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> 17th November 2018 </li>
    <li><strong>Result:</strong> Mandatory title, only neutral titles are "Dr" and "Prof". Binary gender is asked for later in the application process.</li>
    <li><strong>Method:</strong> In-branch (Crewe) </li>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> 17th November 2018 </li>
    <li><strong>Result:</strong> The staff member I spoke to mentioned that there was an internal meeting recently about handling transgender and neutral customers. As such, guidelines (available as a PDF on their staff website, search for "Mx title") have been issued on how to work around the lack of "Mx" in their internal systems when it is requested by a customer. This involves setting the title to blank or unknown, depending on the system, and putting a note on the account that the customer wishes to be addressed as "Mx". Visa card services will also be sent a note requesting "Mx" to be printed on the card. Gender can also be left blank when setting up an account on the in-branch system. The staff member I spoke to will feed back the issues with the website noted above. Many thanks to the staff of the Crewe branch for guiding me through their processes and being open about what exactly they were doing.</li>
  </ul> 
<h3>Halifax</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Current account</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> Existing customer</li>
    <li><strong>Method:</strong> Face-to-face (Crewe branch) </li>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> 9th July 2016 </li>
    <li><strong>Response:</strong> Would not allow Mx on account or cards. </li>
    <li><strong>Result:</strong> I closed my account. </li>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> 23rd November 2018 (two years later) </li>
    <li><strong>Update:</strong>Thank you to <a href='https://twitter.com/@Scyu_' target='_blank'>@Scyu_</a> for informing me that Halifax Online Banking has a form to request a name change and part of that includes a freeform text box for the title field.</li>    
  </ul>
  
<h3>HSBC</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Current account</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> New customer</li>
    <li><strong>Method:</strong> Online </li>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> 17th November 2018 </li>
    <li><strong>Response:</strong> No Mx in title field, with neutral options "Dr", "Rev", "Sgt", "Prof", "Capt". Binary gender field also applies. </li>
    <li><strong>Note:</strong> I've been told that HSBC will set "Mx" as your title if you ask for it in-branch, much like NatWest did for me years ago. </li>
  </ul>
  
<h3>Monzo</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Current Account</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> No title or gender information requested.</li>
  </ul>
  
<h3>Natwest</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Current account</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> New customer</li>
    <li><strong>Method:</strong> Online </li>
    <li><strong>Result:</strong> Mx title not available. When selecting a neutral option, a mandatory binary gender selector appears. </li>
    <li><strong>Note from Peter:</strong> See below that you can get title in-branch manually, but presumably, not gender. Setting a new account up in-branch may let you select "Mx" from the start.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Current account</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> Existing customer</li>
    <li><strong>Method:</strong> Face-to-face (Knutsford branch) </li>
    <li><strong>Result:</strong> Mx title applied to account and debit card. </li>
    <li><strong>Note from Peter:</strong> When this was done, their main system for doing changes would not let the staff member change the title to Mx. However, the staff member went into some console/DOS looking screens and manually typed in Mx in numerous screens (it took a while, but they were very keen to do it everywhere). Unfortunately, there was one place they missed (paper statements) but I told the Crewe branch and they fixed this straight away.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Credit card</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> Existing customer</li>
    <li><strong>Method:</strong> Phone call </li>
    <li><strong>Result:</strong> Mx title applied to credit card. </li>
    <li><strong>Note from Peter:</strong> Communications (postal/email) use just "M" as a title, despite card saying "MX".</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Post Office Money</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> "Matched" Credit Card</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> Requires a mandatory and gendered title, but what is printed on the card is entirely custom, so you can change the title on the card or remove it entirely (mine says "MX").</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Current account</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> New customer</li>
    <li><strong>Method:</strong> Phone call </li>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> 17/11/2018 </li>
    <li><strong>Result:</strong> Title field is free text box on their system. However, requires a binary gender be selected. I have requested that they add a non-binary checkbox.</li>
  </ul>
  
<h3>Santander</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Current Account</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> Requires a mandatory title during signup. "Mx" is one of the main options, but selecting "Other" gives you a long list of others. Unfortunately, a binary gender is mandatory.</li>
    <li><strong>Contact date:</strong> 16/11/2018 - awaiting response</li>
  </ul>
  
<h3>Scottish Widows</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Pension</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> When initially set up, they copied over what my workplace set as my title (assumed Mr). When I phoned them up to request the title change, they originally asked for deed poll until I eventually talked them down to just requiring a letter "with a signature". I then forgot about needing to send a letter until I moved house and they sent something to the old address and used "Mr" as title. So, when I phoned about changing address, I also asked about changing my title to "Mx", which they did immediately on the phone. I did not mention the request for a letter on this second attempt.</li>
    <li><strong>SHAME UPDATE - 29th October 2018:</strong> The latest letter from Scottish Widows has returned to using "Mr". I will be contacting about this.</li>
  </ul>
  
<h3>Starling Bank</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Personal Current Account</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> Requires a mandatory title during signup. "Mx" is available on <strong>Android only</strong>, on iOS the only neutral option is "Dr".</li>
    <li><strong>Contact date:</strong> 16/11/2018</li>
    <li><strong>Response:</strong> This was a mistake (obviously) and is due to be included in version 0.69 (nice) of the iOS app. Will confirm when released.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Yorkshire Building Society</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contributed By:</strong> h0m54r</li>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Mortgage</li>
    <li><strong>Report:</strong> When I applied for a mortgage with YBS, the paperwork I saw listed Mx as a selectable option along with the more traditional titles. Donâ€™t know if that applies to their other products.</li>
  </ul>
